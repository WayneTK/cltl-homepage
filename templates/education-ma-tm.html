        Our master program targets students with:
    </p>
        <ul>
           <li> a linguistics background and an interest in technology or</li>
           <li> computer science/AI students and an interest in language and text as data or</li>
            <li>students in other disciplines (humanities, social science, medical, legal, finance and business)
                that have an interest in language and computational technologies to treat language as data.</li>
        </ul>

    <h5>Text Mining: a master not only for linguists and AI students!</h5>

    <p>
        For mining information from very large repositories of text, you need to know what you are looking for and
        how to find it. The Master’s programme Text Mining trains everyone with a Bachelor’s and or Master’s degree
        how to use text mining by applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. You will learn what the possibilities
        and limitations are, and how to reflect on the outcomes and the cross-disciplinary aspects. Students finish the
        program by carrying our research for a final thesis project, which is usually done in the course of an internship
        at a company or organization. Such an internship can serve as a stepping stone for a future career.If you are
        interested in what kinds of projects our students carry out at the end of their studies, please have a look at
        <a href="{{ url_for('education_theses') }}">completed and ongoing theses projects.</a>
