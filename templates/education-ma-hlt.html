    <p>
        Human Language technology or Natural Language Processing is a rapidly developing research field.
        In current Humanities research, a firm background in language technology is extremely valuable for
        modelling Big (!) datasets. The Computational Lexicology and Terminology Lab (CLTL) offers a specialization
        in the research master Humanities in which students are trained in human language technology and natural language
        processing. A human language technology expert has knowledge of technology as used in computer applications
        (e.g. search engines) and of relevant linguistic theories. Students finish the program by carrying our research
        for a final thesis project. Such a project can either be carried out with a company our be embedded in ongoing
        research at our lab. If you are interested in what kinds of projects our students carry out at the end of their
        studies, please have a look at <a href="{{ url_for('projs_completed') }}">completed and ongoing theses projects</a> and browse the list of
        available <a href="{{ url_for('education_theses') }}">thesis topics.</a>
